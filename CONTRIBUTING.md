You are welcome to make PRs. Basic guidelines follow:

- Conform to stylus specifications
- Prefer parameterized variables over hardcoded values
- Use sections to demarcate semantically different parts of the page from each other
- Indent CSS with four spaces within each section
- Use conditionals for any parametric logic: do not force DOM elements off and prevent the user from restoring them
