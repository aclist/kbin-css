# Description

Parameterized kbin style sheet aimed at readability and decluttering.

The base theme makes some changes to the layout and starts with severable icons/widgets/features disabled, such as
avatars, thumbnails, icons, the sidebar, etc.

To enable/disable the widgets you prefer, use the radio buttons.

This theme has chiefly been tested at 1440P and on a desktop environment at different scaling levels.
